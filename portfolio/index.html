                        </h3>
                        <p>This was my first real live website, used by my wife's family and my own. I created this using the Bootstrap framework and a little bit of JavaScript for the count down timer. It took me a while to get everything right, especially with creating circle images. I had a lot of fun creating this project, I also enjoyed the compliments from family. In a business sense this likely increased our registry visits and items bought there.</p>

                        <p>This is a sample App page I created using Bootstrap. This was an early project I did, that I found extremely interesting with valdidation's for email; as well how nice a simple one page website looks for an App advertisment. I think this template could prove very useful for future projects.</p>

                        <p>This website is my school project that started it all. Here I learned and experimented with bootstrap. I also learned how to integrate a login system with PHP and MySQL; I then connected this to a website forum for our reviews area of the website. I thoroughly enjoyed being the head developer of my team, learning the back-end and front-end of a website, giving me great a experience. We presented this website at Kent State University to the Northeast Ohio Technology Committee, which included big company executives. In the end we were deemed the best project and given job opportunities do to this. It also sparked a start-up with us and former alumni students.</p>

                        <p>I am a Computer Information Systems graduate from Kent State University. I have learned web development off and on for two years, but only in recent months have I started learning web development seriously. Web development has become something I love doing and a true passion of mine. My goal is to work as a full-time web developer for a great company and even have my own freelance side business in web development.</p>
